BudgetLens is the open-source receipt scanner and expense tracker made for self-hosting. Receipts in any language and currency can be uploaded in a matter of seconds. The AI analyzes the picture and immediately adds it to your expenses. You can overview your expenses on the dashboard. The UI is very simple and self-explanatory but can be further improved by fellow contributors. Find out more on [how to contribute](#how-to-contribute).

## Architecture

- This is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) App using the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) for image recognition and categorization and the [Open Exchange Rates API](https://openexchangerates.org/) for currency conversion.
- The data is stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) DB and images are stored on the Linux filesystem.
- The UI is made with the static build-in templating engine of Django.

### Components

Typical for Django we have different components. As this is a simple and robust application, I kept it to the minimum amount. There is the default component budgetlens holding the configurations, the core including all the business logic and the accounts component handling the user lifecycle:

![Components](./.extras/documentation/img/components.png)

### Entity Relationship Model

Essentially there is only one entity and one extension for the Django user:

![ERM](./.extras/documentation/img/erm.png)

### Deployment

The deployment architecture is kept as simple as possible with one external DB and the Application Server:

## Local Installation
>
> [!NOTE]
> A [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation of the version 3.12 is required to run this project.

1. First create a python virtual environment in the root directory:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

1. Activate the venv:

    - Windows:

        ```PowerShell
        .\venv\Script\activate
        ```

    - Mac / Linux:

        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

1. Upgrade pip if necessary:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Initialization

After the basic installation, you have to initialize the Django App and DB properly. First we need to start the DB. In order to get started easy, I have provided a docker compose script in `.extras/compose` for the DB.

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires at minimum a [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) installation.

1. **Start the DB:**

    In a terminal execute the following prompts.

    ```bash
    cd ./.extras/compose
    ```

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

1. **Setup environment variables:**

    In another terminal window execute the following steps.

    - You need to create a `.env` file in the `budgetlens` directory.

        ```bash
        cd budgetlens
        ```

        - Windows:

            ```PowerShell
            New-Item -ItemType File -Name ".env"
            ```

        - Mac / Linux:

            ```bash
            touch .env
            ```

    - Within this file you have to specify the following env variables:

        ```dotenv
        DB_NAME=budgetlens
        DB_USER=postgres
        DB_PASSWORD=postgres
        DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
        DB_PORT=5432

        ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost

        OPENAI_API_KEY={insert your own API key here}
        OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_API_KEY={insert your own API key here}
        ```

        > ❗**Important**
        >
        > Keep in mind, these are only example variables. Never ever upload or expose them to the public.
        > Be especially careful with API keys.

1. **Migrate the DB:**

    > ❗**Important**
    >
    > The Python `venv` has to be activated for these steps.

    In another terminal window execute the following prompts.

    ```bash
    cd budgetlens
    ```

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    ```

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

1. **Create a superuser for Django Admin:**

    Try not to forget the credentials you will create.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

## Application Start

Now that we are all setup, it is time to start the application.

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

By default you can find the login screeen at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
